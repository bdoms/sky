0.0.7 / 2013-02-07
------------------
* Forgot `nextflow` dep.
* `sky-build` is now using `jsoncfg` and `self` now contains all of the header data from each Markdown file.
* starting to remove lib/cli.js for module `cl`.
* Changed template / index format a bit. 
* Added RSS feed generator.


0.0.6 / 2013-02-07
-------------------
* First usable release under the new name.
* A lot has changed since it was named `potter`.


0.0.5 / 2013-01-24
------------------
* Renamed `Potter` to `Sky` because I didn't like that the Node.js package name `potter` was taken. I was using `pottercms`.
